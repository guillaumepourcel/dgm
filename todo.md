# Get familiar with the code
- [ ] Check how the agent works on a single/multiple tasks
    - [ ] Understand a single task.
    - [ ] Understand how it's called in the full loop.
    - [ ] Launch an eval on cheaper models
      - [ ] On the dataset of tasks.
      - [ ] On the self-improvement also.


# Test on the full loop (with restricted dataset)
- [ ] Test new open source models
- [ ] Test with self-improvement based on truth --> error correction!
- [ ] Test with self-improvement based on multi-agent feedback.
